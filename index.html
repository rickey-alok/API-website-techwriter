                <p id="cursive">This is an effort to create a website where all API related information can be found at one place without any hussle. In addition, one of the main objective of this website is to have the informatoin available in very simple and easy to understand language. I believe that everyone should have access to bare minimum information about the API and be able to understand it.
                <br><br>
                When we talk about the API writing, mostly it is being refered as 'Docs-as-Code' concept, which means writing documentation using the tools and processess that developers used to code. 'Docs as code' also refers as an agile mindset for documenting content. 
                <br><br>
                To get a bit aligned with the developer's mindset, here are some list of developer centeric tools/applications that will help you get familiarized their way of working.

                </ul>
                <p id="cursive">And here is the list of topics that would be helpful documenting API content.

                    But before diving into any of the above mentioned topics, it would be a good idea to start with an understanding first, <a href="./MapAPI.html">WHAT IS AN API?</a>
