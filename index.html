          <h1>Welcome to Our API Hub: Simplifying Technical Information</h1>
          <p>
            At our website, we’ve made it our mission to consolidate all

          <h1>Understanding `Docs-as-Code`</h1>
          <p>
            When we discuss API writing, we often refer to the concept of
            ‘Docs-as-Code’. This approach involves creating documentation using
            the same tools and processes that developers use for coding. It’s
            not just about writing; it’s an agile mindset for documenting
            content effectively.
          </p>
