            hassle—just straightforward access to essential details. Our primary
            objective is to present this information in a simple,
            easy-to-understand language. After all, everyone should have access

            When we discuss API writing, we often refer to the concept of
            ‘Docs-as-Code’. This approach involves creating documentation using
            the same tools and processes that developers use for coding. It’s
            not just about writing; it’s an agile mindset for documenting
            content effectively.
          </p>
          <p>To align with the developer’s mindset, here’s a list of tools and applications that will help you get acquainted with their way of working:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</b>: A versatile code editor that developers love</li>
              <li><b>Git & GitHub</b>: Essential for version control and collaborative development</li>
              <li><b>Jenkins</b>: An automation server for continuous integration and delivery</li>
              <li><b>AWS Cloud</b>: Dive into cloud computing with Amazon Web Services.</li>
              <li><b>Postman</b>: Simplify API testing and collaboration.</li>
              <li><b>Jira</b>: Manage your projects efficiently.</li>
            </ul>  
            <p>One of the best things is that you don’t need to spend a single penny to access these above software tools, as they are all open-source.</p>
