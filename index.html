            This is an effort to create a website where all API related
            information can be found at one place without any hussle. In
            addition, one of the main objective of this website is to have the
            informatoin available in very simple and easy to understand
            language. I believe that everyone should have access to bare minimum
            information about the API and be able to understand it. <br /><br />
            When we talk about the API writing, mostly it is being refered as
            'Docs-as-Code' concept, which means writing documentation using the
            tools and processess that developers used to code. 'Docs as code'
            also refers as an agile mindset for documenting content.
            <br /><br />
            To get a bit aligned with the developer's mindset, here are some
            list of developer centeric tools/applications that will help you get
            familiarized their way of working.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>VS code</li>
            <li>Git & GitHub</li>
            <li>Jenkins</li>
            <li>DevOps</li>
            <li>AWS Cloud</li>
            <li>Postman</li>
            <li>Jira</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And here is the list of topics that would be helpful documenting API
            content.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Markdown</li>
            <li>OpenAPI Specification</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But before diving into any of the above mentioned topics, it would
            be a good idea to first start with a very simple topic
            <a href="./VSCode.html">VS Code.</a>. Before we hit the final topic
            about the API and its implementation, we'll overcome these smaller
            topics that would be a stepping stone in mastering the API concept.
