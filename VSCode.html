            VS code, also known as Visual Studio Code, is a lightweight and
            powerful open-source code editor by Microsoft. It is prevalent
            amongst the developer community to build and debug applications.
            <br /><br />
            It supports almost all sorts of programming languages for building
            applications, which makes it a super-friendly Integrated Development
            Environment (IDE) for developers. Yet, many extensions are available
            for writers that help in formatting content or auto syntax
            correction, which elevates writers productivity. <br /><br />
            VS code also integrates well with the Git and GitHub which makes
            collaboration easier and faster.
