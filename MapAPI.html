            Imagine you’re developing a food delivery app similar to Zomato or
            Swiggy. You want to incorporate a map (using Google Maps) that
            displays the registered users’ locations and the distance between
            their location and the restaurant once an order is placed. As the
            owner of the food delivery business, would you prefer spending time
            creating a map service from scratch, or would you opt for an
            existing solution like the Google Maps API and focus on your core
            business?<br /><br />
            In my view, it’s evident that leveraging an established service is
            the way to go. And when it comes to mapping services, what better
            choice than utilizing the “Google Maps API”?
            <br /><br />
            Now, let’s explore how we can seamlessly integrate the Google Maps
            API into our app (or website).

            Certainly! Let’s explore how to integrate Google Maps into your app.
            Whether you’re building a travel app, a food delivery service, or
            any other application, leveraging the power of Google Maps can
            enhance user engagement and provide valuable location-based
            features.<br /><br />Here are the essential steps to integrate
            Google Maps into your app:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Obtain a Google Maps API Key:
              <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
                <li>
                  Before diving into programming specifics, you’ll need to get
                  an API key from Google. This key is unique to your application
                  and allows Google to authenticate your app’s requests.
                </li>
                <li>Visit the Google Cloud Platform Console.</li>
                <li>Create a new project or select an existing one.</li>
                <li>Navigate to “APIs & Services” -> “Credentials”.</li>
                <li>Click “Create credentials” -> “API key”.</li>
                <li>After creating, copy the API key for later use.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>

                <li>
                  Google Maps integrations go beyond basic navigation. Whether
                  you’re building a location-based app, a delivery service, or a
                  real estate platform, incorporating Google Maps into your
                  application can significantly enhance user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To integrate Google Maps into your app on the backend, you’ll
                  need the Java client library for Google Maps API Web Services.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Front-End Integration (Web)
              <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha">
                <li>
                  Generating custom map links to direct users to specific
                  locations on maps.google.com..
                </li>
                <li>
                  Using the Static Maps API to display non-interactive snapshots
                  of locations.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Remember, Google Maps provides a wealth of features beyond basic
            mapping, including geocoding, directions, and places. Choose the
            integration approach that best suits your app’s requirements, and
            unlock the world of location-based possibilities!
